Simple Java library to communicate with Ubiquiti UniFi controller.

Very limited and to the point implementation to support my current use case of controlling the PoE mode on certain switch port.  
Tested only on a UDM.  
Requires Java 11 (uses HTTPClient).

If there is any interest in further features, create an issue or a PR and let's grow the library.

Inspired by https://github.com/Art-of-WiFi/UniFi-API-client

Also looked at https://ubntwiki.com/products/software/unifi-controller/api and https://bartsimons.me/playing-around-with-the-ubiquiti-unifi-controller/ while experimenting.
